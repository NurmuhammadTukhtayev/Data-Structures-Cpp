# Binary Tree
--- 
</p> A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children. Each node of a binary tree consists of three items: </p>

- data item
- address of left child
- address of right child

# Types of Binary Tree
~~~
1. Full Binary Tree
~~~
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node/internal node has either two or no children.

2.Perfect Binary Tree
~~~
A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

3. Complete Binary Tree
~~~
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences

- Every level must be completely filled
- All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
- The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.

4. Degenerate or Pathological Tree
~~~
A degenerate or pathological tree is the tree having a single child either left or right.

5. Skewed Binary Tree
~~~
A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes. Thus, there are two types of skewed binary tree: left-skewed binary tree and right-skewed binary tree.

~~~
6. Balanced Binary Tree
~~~

It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
